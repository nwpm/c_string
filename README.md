# c_string

## Description

'c_string' - This is a small library written in C language,
providing various functions for working with strings.
It was written for educational purposes,
to study the basics of development in C language.

**Key features**

Exists in two versions:

- Version with stdlib.h (`use-stdlib-memory` branch)
- Version that does not use any dependencies (`master` branch)

## Possibilities

- Copying and comparing strings (`c_strcpy`, `c_strcmp`, etc.)
- Splitting a string by character (`c_split_delim`)
- Searching for a substring (`c_strstr`)
- Converting a number to a string and forward (`c_itoa`, `c_atoi`)
- Working with substrings and replacing substrings (`c_str_replace_first`)
- Wrappers with checks and safe work with buffers
